                <p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a technology that gives machines the ability to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, decision-making, and problem-solving, by analyzing vast amounts of data to find patterns and make predictions. It's a broad field that includes technologies like machine learning and natural language processing, used to create systems that can see, understand language, analyze data, and even generate new content</p>

                </h3>

                <p>Date: September 2025</p>

                <p>ML, or Machine Learning, is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve at tasks without being explicitly programmed. By training algorithms on data, an ML system develops a model capable of making predictions, decisions, or content generation, and its accuracy increases with more training data and experience. ML powers many modern applications, from recommendation systems and fraud detection to autonomous vehicles</p>
